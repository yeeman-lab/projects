Hi all! This is my GitHub page where you can find a selection of projects I've completed while progressing through the computer science study. These projects are a testament to my journey in acquiring practical skills and knowledge in the field.

## Let me give you a glimpse into what you'll discover here:

- [Node.js, React & PostgreSQL: Simple Web Application for managing notes efficiently.](https://github.com/yeeman-lab/Sticky_Notes)
